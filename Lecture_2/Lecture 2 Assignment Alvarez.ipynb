    "Consider the following experiment:\n",

    "1. The experiment consists of $n$ identical trials.\n",
    "2. The outcome of each trial falls into one of $k$ classes or cells.\n",

    "4. The trials are independent.\n",
    "5. The random variables of interest are $Y_1 , Y_2 , . . . , Y_k$, where $Y_i$ equals the number of trials for which the outcome falls into cell $i$. Notice that $Y_1 +Y_2 +Y_3 +···+Y_k =n$.\n",
    "6. The joint probability distribution $P(y) = \\frac{n!}{y_1!y_2!y_3!...y_n!} P_1^{y_1} P_2^{y_2} P_3^{y_3}....P_n^{y_n}$\n",

    "Question 1: Show that the expected value $E[y] = \\Sigma y \\cdotp P(y) = n \\cdot p_i$ <br> <br>\n",
    "To show that the expected value $E[Y_i] = \\sum_y y_i P(y) = n \\cdot p_i$, we need to use the given joint probability distribution and the definition of expected value.\n",
    "The joint probability distribution is given as:\n",
    "$$P(y) = \\frac{n!}{y_1!y_2!y_3!...y_k!} p_1^{y_1} p_2^{y_2} p_3^{y_3}....p_k^{y_k}$$\n",
    "where $y = (y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_k)$ represents the number of trials in each cell, and $\\sum_{i=1}^k y_i = n$.\n",
    "The expected value of $Y_i$ is defined as:\n",
    "$$E[Y_i] = \\sum_y y_i P(y)$$\n",
    "We can expand this sum by considering all possible values of $y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_k$ such that $\\sum_{i=1}^k y_i = n$:\n",
    "$$E[Y_i] = \\sum_{y_1=0}^n \\sum_{y_2=0}^{n-y_1} \\sum_{y_3=0}^{n-y_1-y_2} \\ldots \\sum_{y_k=n-\\sum_{j=1}^{k-1} y_j} y_i \\frac{n!}{y_1!y_2!y_3!...y_k!} p_1^{y_1} p_2^{y_2} p_3^{y_3}....p_k^{y_k}$$\n",
    "Now, let's focus on the term involving $y_i$:\n",
    "$$y_i \\frac{n!}{y_1!y_2!y_3!...y_k!} p_1^{y_1} p_2^{y_2} p_3^{y_3}....p_k^{y_k}$$\n",
    "We can factor out $p_i^{y_i}$ and $y_i!$ from this term:\n",
    "$$y_i \\frac{n!}{y_1!y_2!y_3!...y_k!} p_1^{y_1} p_2^{y_2} p_3^{y_3}....p_k^{y_k} = \\frac{n!}{(y_i-1)!(y_1!y_2!y_3!...y_{i-1}!y_{i+1}!...y_k!)} p_1^{y_1} p_2^{y_2} p_3^{y_3}....p_i^{y_i-1}....p_k^{y_k}$$\n",
    "Now, we can recognize the term on the right-hand side as the joint probability distribution for $y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_{i-1}, y_i-1, y_{i+1}, \\ldots, y_k$, which we can denote as $P(y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_{i-1}, y_i-1, y_{i+1}, \\ldots, y_k)$.\n",
    "Therefore, we can rewrite the expected value as:\n",
